      Breif Overview on the class of 2025
    </h1>
      <p>   The graduating senior class of 2025
      <span class="question-mark">SENIOR DANCE MAJORS</span> have been working
      and training hard every single day, 5 days a week for the past 4 years.
      Through non stop rehersals and extra time spent outside of school, we put
      in all the hard work and dedication needed to present such an amazing
      show. Over the 4 years we have been training in all styles including
      Ballet, Jazz, Horton Tecnique, Limon Technique, Graham Technique, Tap and
      we even studied Choreography in our 2nd semester of junior year and
      presented our work in the 2024 Junior Projects Showcase. The work that has
      been put in by both the dance department faculty and the senior dance
      majors here at LaGuardia is <em>extraordinary</em> The faculty is the
      guiding tool that us students need in order tofaculty is the guiding tool
      that us students need in order to be sucessful in whatever path and route
      we decide to go on. Without their knowledge, effort, commitement and
      decication, we would not have the abilities and strengh that we have
      today. <br>
The Dance Department provides a rigorous conservatory style training program to build a strong foundation and to support current demands for versatility. We commit to making diversity and inclusion a key component in our training to foster an equitable learning environment for all to thrive. <br>
